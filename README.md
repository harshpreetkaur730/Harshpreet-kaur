The day started with a lecture on the topic"Universal Human Values" by 𝙋𝙧𝙞𝙮𝙖 𝘿𝙖𝙧𝙨𝙝𝙣𝙞 𝙈𝙖𝙢 at 9:00 in the morning. As always, mam was gentle and humble in her tone. Then she started the lecture on the topic 'UV. Mam asked us what is the difference between happiness and excitement. Like, Whatever we do in hope to get happiness is giving us only excitement not happiness in real meaning. Mam told us a simple thing that there is nothing like getting stressed or depressed due to Overthing. The thing is that we are thinking too much but the thoughts are not matching our actions and that's why we are getting stressed. Mam explained it with such a great example that the main motive of the clothes is to cover and protect our body from heat and cold. The average human doesn't need too much or fancy clothes for himself to protect his body but under the influence of the world man is consuming too much from nature just to look fashionable so that he gets compliments which only gives man excitement not happiness in real matters. Her words made a great impact on our minds that we only say that we want to save the environment but when it comes to taking actions we do the totally opposite. After that it was the time for an introduction with Dr. Arvind Dhingra sir. Sir came to the stage and he was full of energy and humour. He talked to some students who had some questions to ask and it was a great time talking to him. After that it was time for a break. After the break it was the English proficiency test. The test was easy and it contained some topics of grammar like transformation of sentences and reading skills like paragraph writing and writing skills like application and email writing.

After that it was time for the maths proficiency test. It was a bit difficult as it contained some topics from 10th standard but I finally made the ends meet. After the maths test the day at the college was over and it was time to go back home.![1000003557](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01d84b37-6de7-47a3-bd34-8781a435e9ca)
