The day started with a lecture on the topic"Universal Human Values" by 𝙋𝙧𝙞𝙮𝙖 𝘿𝙖𝙧𝙨𝙝𝙣𝙞 𝙈𝙖𝙢 at 9:00 in the morning. As always, mam was gentle and humble in her tone. Then she started the lecture on the topic 'UV. Mam asked us what is the difference between happiness and excitement. Like, Whatever we do in hope to get happiness is giving us only excitement not happiness in real meaning. Mam told us a simple thing that there is nothing like getting stressed or depressed due to Overthing. The thing is that we are thinking too much but the thoughts are not matching our actions and that's why we are getting stressed. Mam explained it with such a great example that the main motive of the clothes is to cover and protect our body from heat and cold. The average human doesn't need too much or fancy clothes for himself to protect his body but under the influence of the world man is consuming too much from nature just to look fashionable so that he gets compliments which only gives man excitement not happiness in real matters. Her words made a great impact on our minds that we only say that we want to save the environment but when it comes to taking actions we do the totally opposite. After that it was the time for an introduction with Dr. Arvind Dhingra sir. Sir came to the stage and he was full of energy and humour. He talked to some students who had some questions to ask and it was a great time talking to him. After that it was time for a break. After the break it was the English proficiency test. The test was easy and it contained some topics of grammar like transformation of sentences and reading skills like paragraph writing and writing skills like application and email writing.

After that it was time for the maths proficiency test. It was a bit difficult as it contained some topics from 10th standard but I finally made the ends meet. After the maths test the day at the college was over and it was time to go back home.![1000003557](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01d84b37-6de7-47a3-bd34-8781a435e9ca)

The college started in the afternoon at 1.30 in the auditorium by the lecture on the topic of "Motor sports "by Mr Gautam Murria. Sir came to the stage and wished all of us a very good afternoon and then started talking about motorsports.

First of all he wanted to know how many of the students previously knew about motorsports racing and other activities like this. After that he displayed a picture of the blueprint of a formula 1 sports car on the screen and told us that there are more than 20000 parts in this car which are meant to be in the proper condition and fitted properly to perform well. Then he gave us a question about how we can increase the stability of a race car without exceeding some rules. Some students tried to guess but couldn't make it. Then sir revealed the answer. By adding two wheels to the front of a motorsports car its stability is increased. Then sir moved on to the topic of importance of 3M in motorsports racing. Those 3m were Mind, Milliseconds and Machine. Then we were shown a picture on the screen in which we could see two racecars crossing the finish line just by the difference of 2 milliseconds and the other car behind them by 1 millisecond. After that Sir told us that if any of the students are interested in joining the workshop of a motorsports car then they must join the club. Then it was the time for a lecture on Digital marketing by Dr. Amit Kamra. Sir was left with a little time because most of the time was consumed by the motorsports lecture. So sir started his lecture on digital marketing and told us the basics and some advanced rules of digital marketing and some students asked very interesting questions. The lecture was over in a little time and after that it was the lecture on the 'Millets Super Food' topic by Mrs. Shaffy Makkar mam. She came to the stage and started talking about millets. Firstly no one knew what millets basically are and for what are millets used. Later he showed us some pics of millets that we used in our daily life like pearl millet, barnyard millet, kodo millet, foxtail millet and jawar. We didn't know that those things which are available in our homes for so long are called milletsThen, mam told us the benefits of consuming millets. Millets can cure diabetes and cancer and help women in the middle age who have body pain due to the health problems caused by improper nutrition. Then, mam told us the process of cooking millets and the way of consuming millets properly to gain the total nutrition of millets. She told us to add these Millers to our diet in case of weight loss or weight gain. She told us to add these millets to our diet and have a healthy body. Then it was time to go back home.

Firstly all the students covered their heads and Harpreet mam chose a student to recite the mool mantra for others while the other students heard it and meditated their own energy in themselves. After that Dr Parminder Singh (Dean of the Student Welfare Club) held the stage and started his lecture. His tone of talking was gentle and soothing. His words were very inspiring and had great motivation in them. After that Mr Manpreet Singh came forward to deliver a lecture on the topic "Fitness for Engineers".

His lecture was very inspirational and motivational and last he told all the students present in the auditorium to make a promise that all of us will stay fit and inspire others to be fit. Sir is literally a role model for many people. After that we went to our class to attend the physics lecture by Amarjot mam. It was our first lecture by Amarjot mam.

So today the first lecture was

scheduled at 11 in the morning. So it was not a big deal to reach on time. So the lecture was in the seminar hall near the workshop. It was a lecture by Puneet mam. But due to some problem mam could not reach the seminar hall and one of our seniors was assigned to attend the students for the time. He was very friendly in nature and was very talkative. He told us everything he knew about the exam procedure and the tricks to gain numbers in the exams and he answered all of the students questions very politely. After the lecture it was the time for break and after having too much fun in the break it was the time for a maths lecture in the same previous venue for the maths lecture by Sukhminder sir. Sir was very polite and humble in his tone. He was talking in such a manner that students were very interested in his lecture. Later he introduced us to some applications on the mobile which are proven very useful for us in the fields of mathematics.

Apps like 'Desmos' and 'Geogebra' were something we never heard before and that's why we regret itThose apps are very helpful in making graphs or solving graphical problems and understanding three dimensional objects and their dimensions and designs. After teaching us the right way to use those apps sir casually started a topic about the influence of social media on our daily life and the craze in students to share their every moment detail on social media apps. After this lecture it was time to go back home.
